We want to defer/remove biological details from the main readme. Screenshots On the left is the Napari viewer with a time-series of images, basically a video recording. The Napari viewer has two shapes, a line (blue) and a rectangle (orange). Shapes can easily be created, deleted, and edited using the Napari interface. On the right is the Shape Analysis Plugin interface with four plots. The top plot is showing the line intensity profile along the line shape (white), a gaussian fit (red), and a best guess of the diameter of the line intensity profile (blue). The second plot is showing the best guess of the diameter for each frame in the time-series. The third plot is an image where the line intensity profile of each frame in the time-seriesis vertical. The fourth plot is showing the mean image intensity inside the rectangular shape/ROI, one value per image frame in the time-series. As the user drags the slider to scroll through image frames in the time-series, all the plots are updated. For the bottom three plots, the currently viwed image frame is denoted by a vertical white/yellow bar. Details... The image is a video recording of a [sinoatrial node][sinoatrial-node] artery with [GCaMP][gcamp] expressed in [endothelial cells][endothelial-cells]. Around frame 800 there is a spontaneous Ca++ event within the rectangular shape. Around frame 1300, we are applying high K+ to constrict the vessel. This can be seen as both a decrease in the diameter (second plot) accompanied by an increase in Ca++. Why... We are using this plugin to examine the response of arteries, both in their constriction and Ca++ signalling in different disease states including Alzheimer's disease, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#screenshots","text":"On the left is the Napari viewer with a time-series of images, basically a video recording.
