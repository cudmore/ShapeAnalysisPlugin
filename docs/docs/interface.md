The Shape Analysis Plugin uses keyboard commands for its user interaction. We will improve this in the near future. 

```

Delete: Delete selected shape
u: Update analysis on selected shape
Command+Shift+L: Load h5f file (prompt user for file)
Command+l: Load default h5f file (each .tif has corresponding h5f file)
Command+s: Save default h5f file (each .tif has corresponding h5f file)
```
